🏠 House Price Prediction App

This project is a Machine Learning web application built using Streamlit that predicts house prices based on various features like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, size, location, etc. It includes interactive data visualizations, supports a preloaded demo dataset, and also allows users to upload their own datasets for real-time predictions.

🚀 Features

✅ Predict house prices using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor

📊 Visualize data through:

Correlation matrix

Histograms

Bar charts

Interactive plots using Plotly

📁 Use a built-in sample dataset or upload your own .csv file

📉 Evaluate model performance using R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
